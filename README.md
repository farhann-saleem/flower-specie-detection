# Iris Logistic Regression Prediction

This project demonstrates how to train and use a Logistic Regression model on the Iris dataset using Python and scikit-learn in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Contents
- `predictions.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and explanations for data loading, exploration, model training, and prediction.
- `Iris.csv`: The Iris dataset used for training and testing.

## Steps in the Notebook
1. **Import Libraries**: Load all required Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning.
2. **Load Dataset**: Read the Iris dataset from CSV.
3. **Dataset Overview**: Display the first few rows and column names.
4. **Dataset Description**: Show basic statistics using `describe()`.
5. **Feature Selection**: Prepare features and labels for model training.
6. **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into training and testing sets.
7. **Feature Scaling**: Standardize features using `StandardScaler`.
8. **Model Training**: Train a Logistic Regression model.
9. **Model Evaluation**: Predict and evaluate accuracy on the test set.
10. **Predictions**: Make predictions on new data samples.

## Usage
Open `predictions.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the workflow and results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
